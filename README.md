Much like stocks, wine can be an investment. The unique flavors and qualities that evolve over time via bottle aging is not well-understood, and leads to a variety of incredible bottles that have gained fame over the ages. Think '82 Lafite, 1947 Ch√¢teau Cheval Blanc, etc...

The vision for this winery would be to produce high-quality wine, except we as the producer would write notes for what we predict the bottle to become. 

We'll name our bottles just like stocks. Maybe like $SHROOM 100C for an options-style name, with the idea that mushroom flavors will be pronounced over time.

Hopefully certain bottles will turn out great, and those will be prized, whereas other bottles will just be ok, and the rarity will come from the good bottles.
